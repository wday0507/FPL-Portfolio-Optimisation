Motivation

This project serves as an application of quantitative methods, specifically portoflio optimisation, to the realm of Fantasy Premier League (FPL). Exploring player selection through the lens of optimisation, this project not only demonstrates my undertanding of financial concepts but also integrates skills such as data cleaning, statistical analysis, model delveopment and evaluation.
Additionally, the inherent randomess of football provides a unqiue challenge in applying these methods. As a football enthuasist, this project combines my professional interests with my passion for the psort, making it an engaging exercise. 


Data Sources & Cleaning

The data source for this project is a collection of dataframes from GitHub user "vaastav", who has compiled comprehensive FPL datasets for each season. These datasets contain detailed gameweek statistics for every player, including total points, goals, assists, minutes played, and more. I use data from the 2017/18 season through to 2023/24.
To tailor the data for my analysis, several cleaning and preprocessing steps were required. Key challenges included:
- Inconsistent player names across seasons, e.g. name changes "Heung-Min Son" --> "Son Heung-min" makes it hard to track player perfomance over time
- The dataframes from earlier seasons did not have team names, only opponent team number, this required considerable remapping
